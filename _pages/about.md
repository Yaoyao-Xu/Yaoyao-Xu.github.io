## About Me

I am a 2rd-year CS PhD student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tianshu Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/). My research focuses on AI4Science. 

Before my PhD, I obtained my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the Columbia University, and my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering
from Sichuang University and University of Pittsburgh.
